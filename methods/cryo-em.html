      <h2>Cryo-EM Imaging in Coacervate Research</h2>

      <p>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique that allows us to visualize hydrated biological samples in their near-native state at nanometer resolution. By rapidly freezing specimens and imaging them at cryogenic temperatures, cryo-EM preserves the internal structure of soft materials without the need for staining or dehydration.</p>

      <p>In our lab, we use cryo-EM to investigate the nanoscale organization of protein coacervates. These materials are dynamic, hydrated, and often structurally heterogeneous, making them challenging to image by conventional electron microscopy. Cryo-EM helps us gain a closer look at their internal structure under different conditions, including variations in salt and pH.</p>

      <p>We prepared coacervates formed from recombinant mussel foot protein-1 (rMfp-1) and used cryo-EM to capture their morphology. To ensure optimal droplet size for cryo-EM (<500 nm), we timed the salt-induced coacervate formation directly on-grid based on prior kinetic studies using fluorescent microscopy. Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-induced droplets appeared faster (~30 seconds) than NaCl-induced droplets (~54 seconds), allowing us to fine-tune the imaging window.</p>

      <p>Under cryo-EM, we observed rounded coacervate-like structures under both salt conditions. Interestingly, while our spectroscopic and microrheology analyses revealed clear distinctions in the internal dynamics of sulfate- versus chloride-induced coacervates, these differences were not reflected in their nanoscale morphology—both appeared similarly spherical and featureless at the resolution used.</p>

      <p>This highlights how cryo-EM complements other biophysical tools: while it reveals nanoscale morphology and size, techniques like NMR and optical tweezers help uncover dynamic and chemical differences not visible in static images. Together, they build a more complete picture of coacervate behavior.</p>
