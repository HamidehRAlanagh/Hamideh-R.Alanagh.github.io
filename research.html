      <h2>Bio-Inspired Coacervate Materials</h2>
      <p>We engineer stimuli-responsive protein–nucleic acid coacervates by understanding sequence–structure–function relationships. These soft materials enable controlled microenvironments and adaptive phase behavior, with applications in catalysis, separations, coatings, and energy storage membranes.</p>

      <h2>Reticular Chemistry</h2>
      <p>My doctoral research focused on reticular chemistry, designing porous molecular frameworks with precise connectivity and tunable host–guest interactions. This foundation informs our approach to controlling coacervate architecture at the molecular level.</p>

      <h2>Methods & Tools</h2>
      <p>Our work combines advanced synthetic strategies with state-of-the-art characterization techniques, including AFM-Raman spectroscopy, TOF-SIMS, NMR, optical tweezers microrheology, and cryo-EM. These tools enable us to probe materials across length scales and connect molecular design to function.</p>
