    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    
    <p>In protein science, the sequence–structure–function relationship has been well-established: amino acid sequence determines three-dimensional structure, which in turn governs biological function. But how does this principle translate to coacervate materials, where there is no fixed structure to speak of? Nature uses coacervates extensively—from intracellular membrane-less organelles like nucleoli and stress granules that organize cellular processes, to extracellular secretions such as mussel byssus and web spider silk protein storage that provide mechanical function. These dynamic, liquid-like assemblies form through liquid-liquid phase separation, yet their diverse material properties must still be encoded in the sequence of their constituent polymers. What determines this relationship when structure itself is fluid?</p>
    
    <p>Understanding sequence–function relationships in coacervates requires a different approach than traditional protein design. Instead of predicting folded conformations, we need to understand how polymer sequence controls phase separation thermodynamics, interfacial properties, and material responsiveness. This presents a fundamental question: can we develop predictive rules that connect molecular sequence to macroscopic material behavior in these disordered systems?</p>
    
    <p>In the Nature × Matter Lab, we focus on establishing a systematic <strong>Sequence–Structure–Function Design</strong> framework for coacervate materials. Our research centers on understanding how changes in polymer sequence affect phase behavior, internal organization, and responsiveness to environmental stimuli. We synthesize sequence-controlled polymers and characterize their phase separation using physico-chemical and biophysical techniques such as light scattering, microscopy, and spectroscopy to build quantitative structure–property relationships.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding these principles has practical implications for developing sustainable adhesives, drug delivery systems, and responsive coatings that can adapt to environmental changes.</p>
    
    <p>In synthetic biology, programmable coacervates offer opportunities to create artificial organelles with tunable properties, design cellular compartments for enhanced metabolic processes, and develop bio-inspired materials that can self-organize and respond dynamically. This approach combines precise synthetic control with rigorous characterization to understand how sequence encodes function in these complex soft materials.</p>
